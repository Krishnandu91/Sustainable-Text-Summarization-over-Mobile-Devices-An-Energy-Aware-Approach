# Sustainable-Text-Summarization-over-Mobile-Devices: An-Energy-Aware-Approach

## Tweet dataset for the paper: 
- Title: **"Sustainable-Text-Summarization-over-Mobile-Devices: An-Energy-Aware-Approach"**
- Authors: Krishnandu Hazra, Tanmoy Ghosh, Avirup Mukherjee, Sujoy Saha, Subrata Nandi, Saptarshi Ghosh and Sandip Chakraborty

## Dataset Description:
The dataset contains tweets (from Twitter) posted during 4 disaster events:

 
Name|Description|Size (no. of tweets)
--|--|--
Hgpt|Typhoon Hagupit in Philippines in 2014|500
Hybd|Bomb blasts in Hyderabad, India in 2013|1000
Utkd|Floods and landslides in Uttarakhand, India in 2013|2000
Irma|Hurricane Irma in the Atlantic region in 2017 |10000

## Gold Summaries:
For each dataset **Hgpt**, **Hybd**, and **Utkd**, four gold summaries are prepared by four different human annotators. Each of the gold summaries has 20 tweets. These gold summaries can be used to evaluate the performance of the text summarization approaches. 

**NOTE**: In our work,  **Irma** dataset is only used to analyze the energy consumption trends while executing text summarization approaches on a large-sized dataset. So, the gold summary is not prepared for **Irma** dataset.
